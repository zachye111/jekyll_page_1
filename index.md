### Python Menu

You can see the [code used](https://github.com/zachye111/zach_individual_tri3/blob/main/menu.py) in the python menu.

Creating a Python menu with data structures and try/except statements - the lazy programmer way.

```markdown
`main_menu = [
    ["Swaps", "swaps.py"],
    ["Matrix", "matrix.py"],
    ["Fibonacci", "fibonacci.py"],
    ["Health", "health.py"],
    ["MNMS", "mnms.py"]
]

# Submenu list
sub_menu = [
    ["Swaps", "swaps.py"],
    ["Matrix", "matrix.py"],
]

patterns_sub_menu = [
    ["Health", "health.py"],
]
` 
```


```markdown

- Main list of [Prompts, Actions]
- Two styles are supported to execute abstracted logic
- File names will be run by exec(open("filename.py").read())

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/zachye111/jekyll_page_1/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
